        <p>
          My journey into software engineering is anything but traditional — and that perspective
          is what makes my approach different. I began my career in retail, working directly with
          customers and store operations. That frontline experience gave me a deep understanding
          of how technology impacts real people in real time.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I advanced into leadership before transitioning into corporate security within the
          Global Security Operations Center, monitoring enterprise systems and supporting incident
          response initiatives. Alongside my corporate path, I served as an educator and counselor,
          building expertise in communication, leadership, and human development — the foundation
          that shapes how I build technology today: with empathy, accessibility, and user-centered
          thinking.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Today, I operate at the intersection of <strong>engineering execution</strong> and
          <strong>human impact</strong>, building systems that are technically strong and
          people-focused.
