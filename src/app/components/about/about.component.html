        <h3 class="about-subtitle">The Intersection of Engineering &amp; Human Impact</h3>
        <p class="about-tagline">A Non-Traditional Path Built on Real-World Perspective</p>

        <p>
          The journey into software engineering began with a foundational background in education, counseling,
          and retail operations—a unique trajectory that now defines a distinctive approach to technology.
          Early career experience on the retail frontline provided a deep, firsthand understanding of how
          digital solutions impact users in real-time environments.

        <h3 class="about-subheading">From Operations to Enterprise Security</h3>
        <p>
          Career growth led from leadership roles into corporate security within a Global Security Operations
          Center. This phase focused on monitoring enterprise systems and supporting critical incident
          response initiatives, instilling a rigorous standard for system reliability and security.

        <h3 class="about-subheading">The Foundation: Empathy, Leadership, and Development</h3>
        <p>
          Concurrent with a corporate path, dedicated service as an educator and counselor built a
          master-level expertise in communication, leadership, and human development. These core competencies
          serve as the blueprint for modern technical execution, ensuring that every system is built with
          empathy, accessibility, and user-centered thinking at its heart.
        </p>

        <h3 class="about-subheading">Engineering with Purpose</h3>
        <p>
          Today, the work operates at the vital intersection of <strong>engineering execution</strong> and
          <strong>human impact</strong>. The result is the delivery of robust, technically superior systems
          that remain deeply focused on the people they serve.
